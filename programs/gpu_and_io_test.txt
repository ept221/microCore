        nop             // Need to start with a nop to fill fetch pipeline
        ldi r0, 1
        out r0, 0       // set the first pin to output
        ldi r0, 0x00    // setup gpu pointer
        ldi r1, 0x20

poll:   in r2, 2        // read pin register
        ani r2, 2       // mask the button
        sll r2          // get the state of the button in the lsb
        out r2, 1       // set the led to the state of the button
        adi r2, 48      // calculate the ascii (0 or 1) state of the button
        str r2, p0      // write the char to the screen
        jmp poll        // poll the button again


Note that this does not protect against writing to the same location as
the gpu is trying to read from at the same time. A better method would be to
implement a print function which waits for the blanking period to write to
the memory.
